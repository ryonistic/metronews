# metronews
News website with Bootstrap and Django monolith.
Warning - This is not a real website.
---------------------------------------
Much of the front end was built using pre-written CSS from Bootstrap and major free HTML templating services.
This is a repository with the sole purpose of showcasing my very first Django project and how I designed the entire thing as a monolithic news website. 
***There is not enough documentation because this was my first project and I didn't bother documenting anything. That is an amateur way of thinking and I believe I have grown since.***
The banner post as well as the two featured posts are sorted from the backend by pushing tags on the posts. These tags are "is_banner", "is_featured", etc.

<p>Lower Half of the Home page
Shows and stationary right sidebar and a scrollable featured posts section. These are automatically sorted from the backend and will only show up on the frontend if the posts are marked as being worthy of the front page.</p>
