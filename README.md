News website with Bootstrap and Django mono
Warning - This is not a real website. Much of the front end was built using pre-written CSS from Bootstrap and major free HTML templating services.
This is a repository with the sole purpose of showcasing my very first Django project and how I designed the entire thing as a monolithic news website. 
---------------------------------------
***There is not enough documentation because this was my first project and I didn't bother documenting anything. That is an amateur way of thinking and I believe I have grown since.***
